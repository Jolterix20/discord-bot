# Discord Bot

This is a bot designed to present the weather of any given city and tell jokes.

**Libraries Used:**

-   Discord.js: The official discord library for Node.js.
-   Axios: For making HTTP requests to the API endpoints.
-   dotenv: For using environment variables inside our code.
-   lodash: For the string formatting functions.
-   nodemon: For reloading on save.

This project solidified my understanding and application of working with promises using async/ await and error handling.

Still thinking of more features to be added in the future.
